This Repo created for save and share mini projects and practices in python, That updated in time.

# Season1 Input/Output
## [1.Calculate Area of Parallelogram](https://github.com/AziziMR98/python-practice/blob/main/Season1_input_output/1.Area%20_of_%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bparallelograms.py)

This program calculates the area of a parallelogram based on user-provided base and height values. After receiving valid numeric inputs, the program displays an ASCII illustration of a parallelogram and prints the calculated area.
It serves as a beginner-friendly Python practice project covering topics such as user input handling, basic validation, function structuring, and simple geometric computation.

## [2.Cylinder Calculator](https://github.com/AziziMR98/python-practice/blob/main/Season1_input_output/2.Volume_and_area_of_%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Ba_cylinder.py)

This program calculates the *volume* and *surface area* of a cylinder based on user-provided radius and height. It validates the input values, displays an ASCII representation of the cylinder, and prints the final results.
The project serves as a basic Python practice exercise covering topics such as classes, user input handling, error checking, and simple geometric calculations.
